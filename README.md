Programming Language and framework: Python, Django, bootstrap

This application I built is a blog style web application where different users can write different posts. These posts can be blog posts or twitter updates.
The application has an authentication system that allows users to log in and log out of their accounts.

New users can create an account from  the register page and if you already have an account, you can log in from the login page as shown below.
On the login page, there is a “forgot password” link that allows users  to reset their password.

A logged in user can view his profile and can update his profile picture as well as email address and username. The picture is automatically resized in the background incase the picture is too large to save room on our web server

On the homepage, each user can view their posts as well as posts by others. Each user can update or delete their individual posts.

I learnt how to work with databases and create authentication systems, accept users input from forms and send emails to reset passwords. Since this is a Django application, I also was able to access the admin page that gave me a nice GUI to view all the backend information and update it on the fly

I used Microsoft visual studio code editor, Django framework and bootstrap for development. . Django is a popular python framework that gives us a lot of functionalities right out of the box and makes it really enjoyable to work with web applications.
I hosted the application on Heroku platform in order to make the application available on the internet and amazon s3 bucket to store my media files.

I hope to improve this application by adding features like commenting and likes
